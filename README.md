# JobApplications
Back End Web API to store applied jobs.
This application allows me to save the many jobs that apply to so I can keep track of them.
Functions include:
- Being able to search by company, job title, date, or pay
- Updating a job application that I posted to see my status (rejected, interview, ghosted, etc)


Goals/Bonus:
- Being able to take a web link and convert it into a job application
- ~~Make it so the save method automatically updates the modified date instead of manually doing it for every update.~~ Done!
- Automatically change application status to ghosted after no response from application date
- Make the params enums?
- If there is already a job application to a company applied in the past, return it as a message when creating a new job application.
- Allow a webaddress to be blank if it's a job posting site like LinkedIn/Monster.

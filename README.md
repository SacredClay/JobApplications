# JobApplications
Back End Web API to store applied jobs.
This application allows me to save the many jobs that apply to so I can keep track of them.
Functions include:
- Being able to search by company, job title, date, or pay
- Updating a job application that I posted to see my status (rejected, interview, ghosted, etc)


Goals/Bonus:
- Being able to take a web link and convert it into a job application
